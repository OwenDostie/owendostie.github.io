Site description
--------------------------------------------
https://100r.co/site/ronin.html
https://e-ec.co/
Main focus of the site is a center column with a min width so that it reads pretty much the same on mobile.
The purpose of the site is as a place for recruiters to access information about me, my projects, and my writing. 
Some google employee will hopefully visit this site in 7 months
Viewers of my site:
    - Potential employers 
    - My friends
    - Job recruiters / potential employers

Navbar is always present, when scrolling down collapses into a hamburger menu
